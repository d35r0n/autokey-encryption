# vigenere-encryption
This is a simple Python program to either encrypt an unencrypted message or decrypt a message that is encrypted using Vigen√®re Cipher.

Usage is pretty easy, just select whether you want to encrypt or decrypt and then enter the decrypted or encrypted text respectively. After that, input the key to encrypt or decrypt the message. Keep in mind, the code won't be decrypted if you don't have the key. Also, the key isn't case sensitive. And the key can only be words or sentences. No special characters are allowed.
